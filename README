django_signed
=============

This project demonstrates a proposed signing API for Django. You can run the 
test suite like so:

    cd examples
    ./manage.py test

The API is under heavy development. It is described in more detail here:

    http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Signing

The mailing list discussion is here:

    http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/133509246caf1d91

TODO:

 - Add support for expiring signatures
 - Try using a class instead of functions, as suggested by Johannes Dollinger
 - Cookie signing functions
 - Middleware that illustrates the proposed request cookie signing API
 - Support key migration from an OLD_SECRET_KEY to the current one
